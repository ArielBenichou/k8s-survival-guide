# Example Backend /w Hono.js
We use `pnpm` as a package manager.

## Run Locally
Start:
```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
Then,
```sh
open http://localhost:3000
# or
curl http://localhost:3000
```

## Run Docker
You can build it yourself with `pnpm build:docker`
or just run it with `pnpm start:docker` it will pull the image from my registery.
